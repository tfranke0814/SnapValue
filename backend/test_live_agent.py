"""
Live test script for invoking the Vertex AI Agent Engine through the AppraisalService.

This script is designed to be run from the 'backend' directory.
It initializes the application's services, uploads a local test image to GCS,
and then calls the appraisal service to get a live appraisal from the deployed agent.

Usage:
1. Make sure your .env file is correctly configured with PRODUCTION credentials
   for GCS and Vertex AI.
2. Ensure the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS path is correct.
3. Make sure the test image 'test_phone.jpg' exists in the 'backend' directory.
4. Run from the 'backend' directory: python test_live_agent.py
